## PROJECT: Testing Practice

This is the sixth project of the Main JavaScript curriculum at [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/) - @microverseinc

This is the sixth project in the Javascript course

The objective is to write tests and create the following function:

- `capitalise(string)`: takes a string and returns that string with the first character capitalized when it's a sentence, it capitalises each word

- `reverseString(string)`: takes a string and returns it reversed

- `calculator`: an object that contains the basic operations (or methods): add, subtract, divide, and multiply

- `caesar`: the caesar function is a [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) with the following features:

  - It takes a string and a key (as shift) and returns an object with two methods: encrypt and decrypt
  - The encrypt method returns an encrypted string while the decrypt takes an encrypted string and decrypts it with the key.
  - It keeps the same case when encrypting or decrypting
  - It encrypts only alphabets and keeps all other characters unchanged including punctuation
  - It wraps from z to a

- `calculator` takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties:

  - `average`
  - `min`
  - `max`
  - `length`
